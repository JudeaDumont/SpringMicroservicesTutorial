- first start the discovery service
- then start 2 inventory services
- using the application.properties file change the port used between them
- one with port 8082
- another with port 0
- then start the product service
- then start the order service
- then use postman to send http://localhost:8081/api/order
- `{"orderLineItemsDtoList":[{"skuCode":"test","price":9.99,"quantity":1}]}`
- then kill the discovery-server
- and run the postman test again. it should be fine, because
- part of eureka is caching the discoverytable registry clientside.
